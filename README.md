# COVID19 Tweets

## Purpose and Scope

Over the past few weeks, COVID19 has dramatically impacted all realms of public life - from where we go to how we interact with one another - everywhere in the world. In North America, while the growing spread of the novel coronavirus was widely known since the beginning of February, its extreme repercussions begun in the week of March 9th, after the suspension of the NBA season and Trump's ban on European travel on March 12. The crisis came into full force in the following week in Canada and USA, leading to a stock market crash, closure of borders to all foreign nationals, mass lay offs and severe social distancing measures. 

The purpose of this project is to allow analysts to examine public discourse via Twitter regarding COVID19 in a period of 7 days leading upto, including and immediately following March 12 - the point at which the crisis truly and fully erupted in North America - and how it related to the growing number of cases and deaths across the world. Some questions that can be tackled with the data gathered in the project are as follows:

* What was the relationship between number of tweets and number of cases in different countries?
* How did the volume of coronavirus related tweets and interactions with coronavirus related tweets change after March 12 in different countries? 
* Do countries with higher number of cases per capita experience higher number of deaths per capita? 
* What was the relationship between number of users publishing tweets, and the number in deaths and countries across different countries?
